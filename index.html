          The spot was perfect for camouflage. At least that's what she thought
          when she picked the spot. She couldn't imagine that anyone would ever
          be able to see her in these surroundings. So there she sat, confident
          that she was hidden from the world and safe from danger.
          Unfortunately, she had not anticipated that others may be looking upon
          her from other angles, and now they were stealthily descending toward
          her hiding spot.
